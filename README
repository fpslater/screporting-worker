Hi.

This is a Rails app that wraps Java in a bunch of places, hence is has a lot of Java dependencies. 
So, it's pretty pointless that this app is written in Rails? I agree, but it wasn't my decision at the 
time. 

What does it do? It's a worker app that pulls some information off a queue and does some stuff with that information.

The bulk of the code is in the model section. There are good examples of subscribing to ActiveMQ, Ruby threading,
and talking to the Facebook Graph API: 

The "driver.rb" class drives the app. This is where I create threads that subscribe to ActiveMQ, pull
from the queue, and process the information.

The "fb_util.rb" class has an example of talking to the Facebook Graph API. It utilizes the Koala gem.
